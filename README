README for sandfox


OVERVIEW
========

Sandfox runs programs within sandboxes which limit the programs’ access to only
the folders you specify. Programs and their child processes, like Firefox
plugins, Flash, and Java, are only able to access files within the sandbox.
Sandfox supports the use of custom profiles which determine what folders and
files are included in each program’s sandbox, and includes default profiles for
Firefox, Skype, and Google-Earth. Sandfox can create separate sandboxes for
each program, or can run multiple programs in one sandbox. Programs are run in
a chroot jail as a normal user, providing a substantial level of security.
Sandfox is designed to be very easy to use. It handles the details for you
while still giving you the ability to construct custom sandboxes easily.
